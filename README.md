# Exec

## Welcome to Code execution report, a light service to track execution of your code (use only for development and experiment).

The project is in developement stage and is not usefull at the moment.

A session is defined to fit few executions together, if you are working on different subjects
An execution is a code block to track, It can be one of the following states: Running, Passive, Exec crushed, Execution crushed

Running: 
Passive: 
Exec crushed: 
Execution crushed: 

The final aim is to get a report after a code block finishes execution in a web service host on the cloud. An important consideration, is that I try to secure the service without any form of authentication.

In progress:
All work is in developement stage, this is the web service. Also different clients are being built: Python, Go, ...
